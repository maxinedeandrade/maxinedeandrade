### Heya! âœ¨

I'm Maxine DeAndrade (nicknames: Max; pronouns he/she), a professional software engineer and hobbyist mathematician. I work on performance-critical applications in Rust for a living. In my free time I like to study pure mathematics.  

  - I contribute to [omnicloud.sh](https://omnicloud.sh), an innovative approach to running distributed cloud applications at scale.

  - As leisure, I work on my side project [catk](https://github.com/meowesque/catk), an analysis framework for C as well as its frontend [cfront](https://github.com/meowesque/cfront).
